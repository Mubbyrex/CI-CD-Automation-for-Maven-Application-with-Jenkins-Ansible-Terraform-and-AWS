# CI-CD AUTOMATION-Project

CI-CD AUTOMATION is a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline project that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for a Java Maven application. The project leverages various DevOps tools and cloud services to ensure a seamless and efficient workflow.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible. The main goal is to automate the entire process from code commit to deployment on a Kubernetes cluster or ec2 Instance, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Different branches contains configurations for different environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Jenkins**: Used for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application.
- **Kubernetes**: Used for container orchestration and deployment.
- **Terraform**: Used for infrastructure provisioning.
- **Ansible**: Used for configuration management and application deployment.
- **AWS**: Used for hosting the infrastructure and services.
- **Linode Cloud**: Used for hosting the infrastructure and services.
- **Maven**: Used for building and managing the Java application.
- **Spring Boot**: Used for developing the Java application.
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing the Java application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **Backend Service**: A Spring Boot application that provides the backend functionality.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform scripts for provisioning AWS infrastructure.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbooks for configuring and deploying the application.
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: YAML files for deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup and Deployment

To set up and deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. **Provision Infrastructure**:

   - Use Terraform scripts in the `terraform` directory to provision the necessary AWS infrastructure.
   - Configure the `terraform/terraform.tfvars` file with your AWS credentials and desired configurations.
   - Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.

2. **Configure Ansible**:

   - Update the Ansible inventory and configuration files in the `ansible` directory.
   - Use the provided playbooks to install Docker, Docker Compose, and other dependencies on the provisioned servers.

3. **Build and Push Docker Images**:

   - Use the `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image for the Java application.
   - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:

   - Use the Kubernetes manifests in the `kubernetes` directory to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is properly configured and accessible.

5. **Set Up Jenkins Pipeline**:

   - Configure Jenkins with the provided `Jenkinsfile` to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Ensure that Jenkins has the necessary plugins and credentials configured.

6. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application.
   - Monitor the pipeline execution and verify the deployment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible. It showcases the automation of the entire process from code commit to deployment, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery.
